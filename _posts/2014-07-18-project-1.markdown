description: Bananrs is a plant care automation project. It is written in the Arduino IDE for the ESP8266 WiFi chip. Bananrs uses sensors to measure temperature, humidity, light level, etc. to automatically water your plants (in my case, bananas). It also uses the Sparkfun API to post data to Sparkfun.
